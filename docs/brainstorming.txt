Nanopore HIV Brainstorming.

What will we need.

Web-Platform
- Sinatra, Vue (or React), webpack, etc.
- nginx for something I can't quite remember.
- Mysql as a database so we can have better parallel processing?
  - OR we can use sqlite3 IF all of our database operations are minimal.  Hmm.
- https://purecss.io/ maybe?


The Goal of the processing is a nice little commandline tool.

The goal of the Web-Platform is to have a nice queue of processing with proper
estimates and job queue # in a nice interactive way.


Not sure how the fast5 files are set organized, they seem like a bunch of copies but of different sizes.

Future TODO:
- Speed optimizations
  - Ruby can't do parallel processing, its a shame.
  - We probably could spawn new processes with the sole purpose of doing blocks of
    alignments.  The main program could coordinate them and keep everything in order.
  - We'd need to define the N spawned processes and JOBSIZE in our settings file.
  - Use just a single clade sequence per subtype.  We could probably use a mixturized sequence.
    - Done (Original:  6m26.998s)   (Optimization:  2m47.180s)
    - Need to see if the results have changed significantly. TODO
- Sequence improvement
  - Slightly longer reference sequences would help with alignment, particularly integrase.
  - According to a paper, nanopore errors are often caused by
    - Homopolymers (somewhat easy to fix)
    - Low complexity Regions (low nucleotide diversity, like homopolymers or ATATATA)
  - Quality values seem useless.
  - Possibly use '?' nucleotides to mark bits as garbage.  Good for single base deletions.
- Need to properly handle GOOD insertions and GOOD deletions.
- Figure out how you are going to do the command line.
- Set up the job status file.



Next steps:
- If a job file is "in progress" and hasn't been written to in over 5 mins, it should be failed.
  - Web server will do this.
- Sanitization for web server*
- Also need to be careful with the input file as they might try to add bash commands to it.
  - Probably can solve by saving file with a job id or something.
- Web side we need to figure out how timestamps/dates work.
- Alignment fixes.
  - I think whereever there is a deletion/insertion, we should try our align to most common sequence strategry.
  - Also, we should probably align to multiple sequences if there are common "clean" subsequences.
    - Important to not include Insertion sequences in the "Clean" list.
- Figure out what pages there should be.  (contact, about, docs?)
